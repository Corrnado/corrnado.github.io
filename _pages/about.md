Hi! My name is Bingjun Li. I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.uconn.edu) at the University of Connecticut under the supervision of [Dr. Sheida Nabavi](https://sheida-nabavi.uconn.edu). I obtained my masterâ€™s in Statistics from [the George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu) in 2017 and my bachelor in Mathematics from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu) in 2014.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
