Hi! My name is Bingjun Li. I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [School of Computing](https://computing.engineering.uconn.edu) at the University of Connecticut under the supervision of [Dr. Sheida Nabavi](https://sheida-nabavi.uconn.edu). I obtained my masterâ€™s in Statistics from [the George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu) in 2017 and my bachelor in Mathematics from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu) in 2014.

My research interests are **AI in Biomedical Science**, **multimodal analysis**, and **graph neural network**. The work I do focuses on this three questions.

1. How to let the model learn the complex structure of biological process?
2. How to better fuse the multimodal data?
3. What can we do to make the model scale up to the future discovery and advancement in biology technology?

And here is the diagram of how all my publications fall into this three categories.
