Hi! My name is Bingjun Li. I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.uconn.edu) at the University of Connecticut under the supervision of [Dr. Sheida Nabavi](https://sheida-nabavi.uconn.edu). I obtained my masterâ€™s in Statistics from [the George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu) in 2017 and my bachelor in Mathematics from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu) in 2014.

My research interest is primaryly in integrative analysis in multimodal biomedical data. The works I do can be divided into three categories.

1. I develope graph-based deep learning models for tasks on multi-omics genome data.
2. I work on intelligent health with electronic health records and medical images.
3. I develop tools about single-cell sequencing data for biologiests.

The key words in my work: **Multimodal Data**, **Genome Data**, and **Graph Neural Network**.
